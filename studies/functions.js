/* 1. The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute
    (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
    
    first:define the function with parameters   
    next:call the function with arguments in place of the parameters
    
 2. What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments
    PASSED to a function?
    parameters:placeholders for values so you can just change the values
    arguments:the actual values; easier to change the value in the function 
    call than to change the parameter;

 3. What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
    function FUNCTIONNAME(parameter1,parameter2){
        code block
    }
    
 4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
    var x = function();

 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs,and OPTIONALLY return a single value.
    How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
    
    inputs are the parameters
    outputs are the arguments 

 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. 
    The inverse is NOT true.

 7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. 
    If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere 
    (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in 
    these closures! (See: our meeting-room app for an example!)
